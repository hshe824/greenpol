## bugs


code thinks elevation axis is done moving before it actually is


galil and encoder position values loose sync with one another, this could propagate over time causing innacurate pointing (plot differences vs time/change in distance).

stop button still doesnt work for horizontal scan (and possibly other things), it just goes to next loop iteration (I think)

forward/backward pass # comments are incorrect, jumps from 1 to 3, figure out the right way to do this(scan.py: linearScan() & horizontalScan())

## more relavent:


add functionality to find offsets (arrow keys that step in some defined increment, update offset each time you move, 
so when you find the correct pointing the offset is however much you have moved, maybe do this in a seperate 
notebook tab)


go through code and make sure comments are up to date and sufficiently descriptive


add cryogenic feedback info, update after each file is produced, average over file

incorporate peters notebook functions into gui



maybe put a save button on live plots so you only save them when you want to



## less relevant

add live plot channel drop down menu option to save/load configurations

note that the precision on these scans is not perfect, figure 
out what precision is required, i think its coming from rounding errors and conversion between cts and degrees.


code to keep telescope from pointing below horizon may need higher limit than 0

it might be possible/better to combine the forward and backward passes into one block of code, use -1**i and a list for min/max az then do list[i % 2] or something like that (scan.py: linearScan() & horizontalScan())



figure out if there is a better way to convert az el coordinates outputted by ephem into degrees(planets.py)

put in logic that allows for different scan times at each elevation(scan.py: azScan())


figure out how to better adjust layout, its weird right now (gui related)

why does the output frame only put text in the middle....?? (gui.py)

put in some logic to azScan to accept hours instead of seconds for tscan, maybe change the default to hours, then if input is less than one, have some logic to convert that to seconds, or maybe timdelta can just handle that. or have an option to do either and you have to specify at input, maybe a checkbox (scan.py, azScan)


create an error message text box in gui, for things like elevation safety controls


get_pointing.py is set up to write files every minute, logic will need to change if we want files more frequently




## commit notes

helical scan pattern added (scan.py)
changed notebook tab az scan to scan (gui.py)
added helical scan to save/load config (gui.py)
changed layout so real time plots are to the right of notebook frame (gui.py)
mask real time 2d color plot where there arent values (gui.py)
changed where live plots are saved (gui.py)
made a pointing_data folder (plot_path.py, get_pointing.py)
added channel drop down menu for live plotting (gui.py)
